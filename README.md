## Pokemon Showdown Replay Analyser

is a website whose aim is to visualise Pokemon Showdown replay data in a more approachable way

# I dont plan on updating this for a while, I might do something when I'm feeling whimsical :)

# How to use
For now, the only supported way is to paste your replay log into the textbox

# Features
- Change your username in the table on the bottom (yes, this is the only thing that currently works)

# Features that were supposed to be added
 - Displaying teams with nicknames and items
 - Showing kill amounts
 - Displaying amount of critical hits, misses etc.
 - Support for pasting urls or files
 - About me and Contact pages (yeah...)
